Making the best cup of coffee using machine learning.

-
####Why
The legend goes that goats were the first animals, witnessed by humans, to eat coffee beans. When they did, they apprantly starting dancing on their hind legs (Don't cite me on this). 

Since then, coffee has grown in popularity. I was being a little modest there. **19.8 Billion pounds of coffee** was consumed in 2014 alone.

So, whats the logical thing to do?

BUILD A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT GIVES THE BEST BREW MEASUREMENT - ofcourse.

####How

1) Research how coffee is made and list the variables that effect the brew experience. Time for our first dictionary entry:

BREWXPERIENCE (adjective): a half-sublime feeling that results in drinking a perfect cup of coffee.
